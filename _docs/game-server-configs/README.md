**Game Server Config Files**

This is a repo of config files designed to be a starting point for the setup of various game servers.

**The Issue**

Game server configs can be found on many different forums and websites. Some are better than others. There can also be misinformation, confusion, or lack of information about what you need in a config file and how you should set up a game server.

**Aim of This Repo**

The aim of this repository is to put together config files for game servers and keep them as generic/vanilla and as standardized as possible. Providing all the important settings server admins need to get started with their game server and avoiding overcomplicating the configs.

**What This Repo Provides**

 - A basic server config with all the essential settings to get started with the vanilla game server.
 - A list of all command variables for the vanilla game servers.

**What Do You Mean by Vanilla/Generic?**

A vanilla/generic server is unchanged from what the game developer intended. It excludes mods or major tweaks to the server settings that are found in a custom server. The exception to this would be any widely accepted settings that improve the performance or are commonly used.

**How to contribute**

There are many different game servers many of which are different. If you run a game server and wish to improve a config please fork this repo and do a PR or if you are not used to Git raise an issue with your changes so it can be added.
